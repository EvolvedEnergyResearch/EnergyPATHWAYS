EnergyPATHWAYS is a macro-energy demand and cost model that offers
flexibility in terms of data input and geographical granularity. Users
can input data in a variety of forms to project energy demand and cost
into the future. Projections can be controlled by user measures that
allow for the simulation and comparison of different test scenarios.
This comprehensive guide is meant to supplement the `documentation originally 
provided with the model <https://energypathways.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,  
and aid users in maximizing its use. The guide begins with installation 
and first run instructions, before offering an overview of the model 
methodology and database setup. The latter part of this document includes 
a description of all relevant database files. This guide is a work in progress, and
:red:`red text corresponds to unknown/uncertain information`. Please email us at zerolab@princeton.edu if you would like to contribute to the guide.
